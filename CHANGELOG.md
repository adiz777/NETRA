# Changelog — indian-fakedata

Both runtimes (`@abhay557/indian-fakedata` on npm, `indian-fakedata` on
PyPI) are versioned and released in lockstep. Reproducibility is guaranteed
within one version; across versions it is not.

## 2.1.0

- NETRA identity generation and deterministic identity lookup.
- Government-ID-style test identifiers for generated identities.
- Family, demographic, education, employment and life-event generation.
- Identity dossier and intelligence-focused web interface.
- Case management with subjects, evidence, notes and timelines.
- Identity relationship and network visualization.
- Intelligence reports and archive views.
- Authentication and protected dashboard routes.
- Health endpoint with deterministic-generation verification.
- Security and session audit interface.
- CLI and programmatic generation remain supported.
- Generated records are fictional test data and are not official government records.
## 2.0.9

- **Employment timeline.** New `employmentTimeline` on every profile:
  chronological job spells (`jobTitle`, `sector`, `occupation`,
  `employerType`, `startYear`, `endYear`, `status`, `monthlyWageINR`,
  `location`). Wages climb towards the current income. Empty for students,
  the unemployed and children; completed-only for retirees.
- **Skills block.** New `skills` on every profile: `technical` and `soft`
  lists, `certifications`, and per-language speaking/reading/writing levels
  (`basic` / `intermediate` / `fluent` / `native`).
- **New narratives.** Layer 3 gains `resume` (CV from education timeline,
  work history and skills) and `customer_support_chat` (Hinglish helpline
  dialogue, masked phone). Appended at the end of `generateAllNarratives`.
- **Persona languages.** Layer 4 accepts `english` / `hindi` / `hinglish`
  (`generateAgentPersona`, `generateEnriched`, `generatePersona`, CLI
  `--persona-lang`). Hindi renders Devanagari + Hindi headers; default
  english output is unchanged.
- **CLI output shaping.** `--fields` (comma-separated, repeatable, dot
  paths, all formats) and `--stats` (stderr distribution summary).
- **Schema + validation.** `getProfileSchema()` / `get_profile_schema()`
  export a versioned JSON Schema (canonical file:
  `schema/profile-2.0.9.json`); `validateProfile()` / `validate_profile()`
  check required fields, enums and provenance markers.
- **PII stripping.** `stripPII()` / `strip_pii()` return a share-safe copy
  with identifiers emptied, shape and provenance kept, `piiStripped: true`
  marker, optional name masking.
- Stability: F1/F2 run on isolated per-profile RNG streams, so `id` and
  every <= 2.0.8 field for a given seed are byte-identical (verified over
  200 seeded profiles in both runtimes).

## 2.0.8

- New nested `appearance` object (face, skin tone, eyes, hair, build).
- Adult `heightCm` shifted by broad geographic region; skin tone uses named
  buckets (`fair`, `wheatish`, `brown`, `deep_brown`, `dark`).
- Agent personas describe appearance in the system prompt.

## 2.0.7

- Correctness release: fixed the Python mulberry32 RNG bias (signed shifts
  skewed every weighted choice) and the DOB/age off-by-one drift.

## 2.0.6

- Provenance markers on every profile: `"synthetic": true` and
  `"generator": "indian-fakedata@<version>"`.

## 2.0.5

- Fixed `generate_enriched` crashing on string seeds such as `"011"`.

## 2.0.4

- Data-pool expansion: 760 districts, 471 surnames, Jain/Buddhist/Muslim/
  Christian first names, 130+ anime titles, more address localities.
  Seeds may resolve to different people than <= 2.0.3.

## 2.0.3

- Added `educationTimeline`, `personalityTraits` and `moviePreferences` to
  every profile.
